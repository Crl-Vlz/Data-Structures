# BST (Binary Search Tree)

## October 4th 2021

---

A binary tree where the nodes are ordered by size of the values.

First we recieve a root node, then depending on the value
if lower is made a left child, else it is made a right child.

This process is recursive, so we know all nodes are ordered by value.

This reduces the search time from O(_n_) to O(_log n_)

**Main Problems:**

- Insertion time is of _log n_

- Requires a full tree
