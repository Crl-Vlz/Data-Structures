# Priority Queue

## 20211103

---

An abstract data structure that works like a list where we can push and pop items. Differing from normal queues,
this data structure has the quality that each node has a priority value. Some nodes that are more important than
others. You push a node normally, and pull the node of most importance.

To implement this structure we need to use heaps.
